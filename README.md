# Lunch i Ã„ngelholm

Well, this is a site that scrapes some restaurant websites and compiles their
lunch menus in one place.

  <dt>Q: Is it pretty?</dt>
  <dd>A: Not in code or in styling!</dd>

  <dt>Q: Does it work?</dt>
  <dd>A: Eh, well enough</dt>
</dl>

Missing a restaurant, have a better way to scrape a restaurant's menu or want
to make a better design? Be my guest, PR's welcome!
